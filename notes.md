# TO DO

[ ] Create a new Firestore database and wire up the connection

[ ] Add the `Add item` form as a Sweet Alert 2 modal so that the user can see the items being added to their list

[ ] Add a "recently purchased" category when the items are clicked purchased in local state, but only local state

[ ] And refactor "inactive" items to ONLY show items that are MORE than double their suggested purchase date

[ ] Add a higher-quality logo. It's just too grainy on desktop
