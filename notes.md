# TO DO

- Add sign out functionality

- Create a new Firestore database and wire up the connection

- Change "blue-ncs" to a prettier blue

- Reduce the font-size in the <ul> on `List.js` on mobile view with md:text-whatever for larger screens

- Refactor the AddItem view into a User view with option to copy-to-clipboard your token or sign out

- Add the `Add item` form as a Sweet Alert 2 modal so that the user can see the items being added to their list

- Add a "recently purchased" category when the items are clicked purchased in local state, but only local state

- And refactor "inactive" items to ONLY show items that are MORE than double their suggested purchase date

- Maybe add a "About Honey Do" modal or something that briefly describes the overall functionality

- Add a higher-quality logo. It's just too grainy on desktop
